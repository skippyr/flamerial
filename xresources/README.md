## Installation

-   Apply the theme by running `xrdb` on the file `flamerial.xrdb`.

```bash
xrdb -merge flamerial.xrdb
```

-   If there are X11 applications open, reopen them to load the theme.

> **Note**
>
> These changes will only remain for your current X11 session. Make them
> persistent by running that same command in X11's startup. Remember to use the
> full path to the script in that case.
