<h1>Flamerial</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Flamerial is low contrast dark color palette with an old feeling.</p>
		<p>It is the result of many tries I have made to create a color palette that satifies my taste.</p>
		<p>It is heavily inspired by these other amazing color palettes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox">Gruvbox Dark</li>
				<li>Twilight</li>
				<li>Solarized Dark</li>
				<li>Ros√© Pine Dark</li>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/metalelf0/base16-black-metal-scheme">Black Metal</a></li>
			</ul>
		<p>If was not for them to exist, probably Flamerial would not be here.</p>
