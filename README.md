# Flamerial

## Starting Point

The Flamerial project is a dark theme with an aged palette. It was inspired
by the [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) theme.

You can setup Flamerial with many wallpapers and themes. Use the following
preview as a source of inspiration of what you can do.

> In the preview, Flamerial was used within the [Kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty)
> terminal emulator with the ZSH theme [Chinatown](https://github.com/skippyr/chinatown).
> Font used is Inconsolata Nerd Font. Interface is [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm).
